OFFSET + Lx + Uy + Fz

L: World Vector Of(Left, Event Player, Rotation)
U: Direction From Angles(Horizontal Facing Angle Of(Event Player), Vertical Facing Angle Of(Event Player) - 90)
F: Facing Direction Of(Event Player)

considering straight U/D
U: (Vertical Facing Angle Of(Event Player) < -89 ? World Vector Of(Backward, Event Player, Rotation) : (Vertical Facing Angle Of(Event Player) > 89 ? World Vector Of(Forward, Event Player, Rotation) : Direction From Angles(Horizontal Facing Angle Of(Event Player), Vertical Facing Angle Of(Event Player) - 90)))
F : (Vertical Facing Angle Of(Event Player) < -89 ? World Vector Of(Up, Event Player, Rotation) : (Vertical Facing Angle Of(Event Player) > 89 ? World Vector Of(Down, Event Player, Rotation) : Facing Direction Of(Event Player)))
